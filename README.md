# Account Abstraction with Solidity Smart Contracts

## Description

Ethereum account abstraction is a revolutionary paradigm shift aimed at significantly enhancing user experience within decentralized applications (DApps). By employing account abstraction, assets are managed directly by smart contracts, moving away from the traditional model of externally-owned accounts (EOAs). This approach is facilitated through the ERC-4337 standard, which introduces a new token standard for account abstraction, thereby enabling the creation of smart contract-based crypto wallets on the Ethereum blockchain.

The concept of account abstraction simplifies the complexity involved in Web3 interactions, offering a seamless and more intuitive experience for users. This simplification is not just about improving wallet design; it's about transforming the entire user interaction with the Ethereum network. Recognized by Ethereum's co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, as a crucial development for Ethereum's future, account abstraction is poised to play a significant role in the platform's widespread adoption.

## Installation

To set up a development environment for exploring account abstraction with Solidity, you will need the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, necessary for running the development environment and various dependencies.
- **Yarn**: A fast, reliable, and secure dependency management system.
- **Hardhat**: A development environment to compile, deploy, test, and debug your Ethereum software.

### Getting Started

1. **Install Node.js**

   Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Install Yarn**

   After installing Node.js, install Yarn by running the following command in your terminal:

```
npm install -g yarn
```


3. **Set up Hardhat**

Initialize a new Hardhat project by running:

```
npx hardhat init
```

## Usage

### Quickstart

To dive into account abstraction using Scaffold-ETH 2, follow the instructions below:

1. **Clone this repo & install dependencies**

```
git clone https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2.git
cd scaffold-eth-2
yarn install
```


2. **Run a local network in the first terminal:**

```
yarn chain
```


This command starts a local Ethereum network using Hardhat. It runs on your local machine for testing and development. Customize the network configuration in `hardhat.config.ts`.

3. **Deploy the test contract in a second terminal:**

```
yarn deploy
```


This deploys a test smart contract to the local network, located in `packages/hardhat/contracts`. Modify it as needed. The deploy script in `packages/hardhat/deploy` is used for deployment. Customize this script to your liking.

4. **Start your NextJS app in a third terminal:**

```
yarn start
```


Visit your app at http://localhost:3000. Interact with your smart contract using the Debug Contracts page. Tweak the app config in `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts`.

5. **Run smart contract tests with:**

```
yarn hardhat:test
```


- **Edit your smart contract** `YourContract.sol` in `packages/hardhat/contracts`
- **Edit your frontend** in `packages/nextjs/pages`
- **Edit your deployment scripts** in `packages/hardhat/deploy`
